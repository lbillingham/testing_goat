# scratchpad for things we _will_ fix about the lists app

    ~~ 1. POST test is to long (stinky) ~~
    ~~ 2. don't save empty `Item()` with every request made to `home_page` ~~
    ~~ 3. whole world shares a single list... I guess everyone needs to know when `user` needs to buy bread and milk ~~
    ~~ 4. table only displays a single item               ~~
    ~~ 5. tests could br DRY-er. We repeat:               ~~
    ~~ ```python                                          ~~
    ~~     request = HttpRequest()                        ~~
    ~~     request.method = 'POST'                        ~~
    ~~     request.POST['item_text'] = 'A new list item'  ~~
    ~~     response = home_page(request)                  ~~
    ~~ ```                                                ~~
    ~~    a couple of times~~
    ~~ 6. functional tests leave traces on the DB after they are run. Make them cklean up after themselves ~~
    ~~ 7. Change model so items are associated with different lists ~~
    ~~ 8. Unique URLs for each list ~~
    ~~ 9. URL for creating a new list: via POST ~~
    ~~ 10. Add URLs for adding new item to extant list via POST ~~
    11. Refactor `urls.py` to reduce duplication
    12. Remove hardcoded URLs from views.py
    ~~13. Remove haardcoded URL from forms in *list.html* and *home.html*~~
